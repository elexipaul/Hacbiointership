**Advances in Docking**

 

The article "Advances in Docking" reviews features of docking programs and their influence on docking accuracy. It proposes a roadmap for improving docking accuracy using newer programs by incorporating quantum-chemical methods and improved global optimization algorithms that minimize simplifications and better account for ligand and protein flexibility.

Molecular docking predicts the interaction of a ligand and a target protein responsible for a disease state. Docking programs estimate binding energies assuming a given binding pose of a ligand in the binding pocket of a target protein. The predicted binding pose is the one with the lowest predicted binding energy. Therefore conventional docking programs search for the low-energy minima. 

**New trends**

Some of the most common docking programs in use today are SOL, Glide, Superflex-Dock, Gold, Dock, ICM, and AutoDock. The virtual screening performance of these programs, however, is not very impressive. These traditional docking programs often rely on pre-calculated grids for protein-ligand interactions, rigid protein models, force-field calculations and simplified solvent models. This accelerates docking for large databases but  compromises the docking accuracy.

Advances in docking have led to the development of new generation programs that use gridless and generalized docking algorithms (e.g., FLM and SOL-P) based on global energy minimization, account for protein-ligand mobility and flexibility, balance speed and accuracy, and use global optimization algorithms that find all low-energy minima including the global minimum. New docking program methods incorporate more precise implicit solvent models like COSMO and quantum-chemical methods such as semi-empirical methods and PM7, without fitting parameters to give more accurate calculations. 

**Conclusion**

The new generation docking programs highlight the limitations of conventional approaches and the benefits of advanced methods. Advances in FLM, TT docking algorithm and SOL-P each offer distinct advantages in exploring low energy spectra, accommodating protein flexibility, and integrating accurate quantum-chemical recalculations. While traditional programs struggle with high-dimensional energy surfaces, the tensor train approach and parallel processing capabilities of FLM and SOL-P represent significant progress.

 These advances hold great promise for the continued evolution of docking methodologies in computational biology and drug discovery. The improved accuracy in docking programs will increase the effectiveness of molecular modeling.
