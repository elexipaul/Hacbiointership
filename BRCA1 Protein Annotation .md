### **Annotation for PDB ID 4OFB: Crystal Structure of Human BRCA1 BRCT in Complex with Nonphosphopeptide Inhibitor**<a id="h.n365qemkwjph"></a>

#### **General Information:**<a id="h.e15cv5jh5q4l"></a>

- **Protein**: BRCA1 BRCT domain (Breast Cancer Type 1 Susceptibility Protein)

- **Source Organism**: Homo sapiens (Human)

- **Resolution**: 1.85 Å

- **Structure Type**: X-ray diffraction


#### **Structural Details:**<a id="h.2hupvap5x2yy"></a>

- **Domains**: The BRCA1 protein contains multiple domains, but this structure specifically covers the BRCT (BRCA1 C-Terminal) domain. The BRCT domain is important for protein-protein interactions involved in DNA damage response.

- **Ligand**: The structure is complexed with a **nonphosphopeptide inhibitor**. Typically, the BRCT domain binds to phosphorylated serine-containing motifs, but this nonphosphopeptide inhibitor mimics key interactions, potentially providing insight into nonphosphorylated peptide binding modes.


#### **Biological Function:**<a id="h.m29962e6gfcu"></a>

- **DNA Repair**: BRCA1, particularly its BRCT domain, plays a crucial role in the DNA damage response, specifically in **homologous recombination repair** (HRR). It mediates interactions with other proteins by recognizing and binding to phosphorylated motifs on target proteins, thus facilitating DNA repair mechanisms.

- **Cancer**: Mutations in BRCA1, particularly affecting the BRCT domain, have been implicated in **hereditary breast and ovarian cancers**. Disruptions in BRCA1's ability to bind phosphorylated peptides can impair DNA repair and lead to increased cancer susceptibility.


#### **Interaction with Nonphosphopeptide:**<a id="h.vijx9s2nzmkj"></a>

- **Inhibitor Binding**: In this structure, the nonphosphopeptide inhibitor binds in the canonical BRCT peptide-binding groove, typically occupied by a phosphorylated serine peptide. This inhibitor competes with phosphorylated peptides and provides insight into the potential design of molecules that could modulate BRCA1 activity.

- **Therapeutic Potential**: This interaction offers a possible avenue for **drug design**, targeting the BRCA1 BRCT domain to inhibit or modulate its function in cancer cells where BRCA1-mediated repair is defective.


#### **Structural Features:**<a id="h.m427tcfx0aa3"></a>

- **BRCT Motif**: The BRCT domain comprises two tandem repeats, each consisting of a three-stranded β-sheet surrounded by α-helices. This fold provides a highly specific binding pocket for phosphorylated peptides.

- **Inhibitor Binding Site**: The inhibitor binds within the peptide-binding groove located between the two BRCT repeats. Key interactions include hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with residues normally involved in recognizing phosphorylated serine peptides.


#### **Functional Implications:**<a id="h.ezvuulobxlwh"></a>

- **Regulation of DNA Damage Response**: The interaction between BRCT and the peptide inhibitor could regulate BRCA1’s role in DNA repair. By preventing the binding of its natural phosphorylated substrates, such inhibitors may influence the repair of DNA double-strand breaks and overall genomic stability.


#### **Key Residues:**<a id="h.s99jdkbz5gkg"></a>

- **Binding Interface**: The key residues involved in binding the nonphosphopeptide inhibitor include **Ser1655, Arg1699, and Lys1702**, which form important contacts with the inhibitor, mimicking the interactions normally formed with phosphorylated peptides.


#### **Research Implications:**<a id="h.20iepicjva3k"></a>

- The structure of the BRCA1 BRCT domain bound to a nonphosphopeptide is valuable for understanding how BRCA1 mutations might alter peptide binding and for designing molecules that could potentially restore or inhibit BRCA1 function in cancer cells.


### **Structural Details:**<a id="h.3d4yfhxsjlcs"></a>

- **Overall Fold**: The BRCT domain consists of a β-sheet surrounded by α-helices, forming a typical BRCT fold. This domain is highly conserved among species and plays a vital role in its interaction with other repair proteins.

- **Inhibitor Positioning**: The nonphosphopeptide inhibitor interacts in the canonical binding groove, which typically accommodates phosphorylated serine residues. The structure provides insights into how modifications in peptide ligands can still allow interactions with this critical domain of BRCA1.

- **Resolution**: The crystal structure was solved at a high resolution of 1.97 Å, providing detailed insights into the binding interactions between the BRCT domain and the inhibitor.


### **Biological Significance:**<a id="h.8i2xgsatyzjt"></a>

- **Cancer Relevance**: Mutations in BRCA1 are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers. The BRCT domain's role in DNA repair makes it a target for drugs that can either enhance or inhibit its function in cells with defective BRCA1, potentially offering therapeutic benefits for individuals with BRCA1 mutations.

- **Inhibitor Implications**: By targeting the BRCT domain with nonphosphopeptide inhibitors, there is the potential to disrupt BRCA1-mediated DNA repair, which could be exploited in cancer therapies, particularly in cancers dependent on DNA damage response mechanisms.


### **Additional Annotations:**<a id="h.se111llodjp4"></a>

- **PDB Resolution**: 1.97 Å

- **Experimental Method**: X-ray diffraction

- **R-value (free)**: 0.226

- **R-value (work)**: 0.195

In the study titled "_Peptide Library Approach to Uncover Phosphomimetic Inhibitors of the BRCA1 C-Terminal Domain_," the **antagonists** used are **phosphomimetic inhibitors**. These are specially designed peptides that mimic the phosphorylated serine or threonine residues, which are normally recognized by the BRCA1 BRCT domain.


### **Key Points:**<a id="h.xjq4dq9juwd2"></a>

- **Phosphomimetic peptides**: These peptides contain non-natural amino acids or chemical modifications that **mimic the negative charge** of phosphorylated residues. They bind to the BRCT domain similarly to natural phosphorylated peptides but often **fail to trigger the correct downstream signaling**, thus acting as antagonists.

- **Inhibitor Design**: The peptide library approach involves generating a variety of peptides with different sequences and modifications to identify those that strongly bind to the BRCT domain but do not activate its function in DNA repair.

- **Goal**: The goal of these inhibitors is to block the BRCA1 BRCT domain's interaction with natural phosphorylated substrates, effectively disrupting BRCA1’s role in **DNA repair** and making it a potential target for therapeutic interventions, especially in cancer where BRCA1 function is compromised.

These phosphomimetic inhibitors prevent the BRCT domain from binding to its natural ligands (phosphorylated proteins) involved in the DNA damage response, making them effective **antagonists**.

**PFF** most likely refers to a **Phospho-binding Functional Fragment** (PFF). PFFs are designed or identified fragments that mimic the phosphorylated motifs typically recognized by the BRCT domain.

For the structure described in **PDB ID 4OFB**, the PFF would refer to the **nonphosphopeptide inhibitor** that mimics the interaction of phosphorylated serine-containing peptides with the BRCT domain, but without the phosphorylation. This nonphosphopeptide inhibitor binds to the BRCT domain in a similar manner to natural ligands but acts as an antagonist, disrupting BRCA1's normal DNA repair function.

**SWISS-MODELLER:** 

**SWISS-MODEL is a web-based tool and server that facilitates the automated generation of high-quality 3D models of protein structures. It uses homology modeling (also known as comparative modeling), where the 3D structure of a target protein is predicted based on its sequence similarity to known protein structures (templates).**

**Key features of SWISS-MODEL include:**

- **Template Search: Finds and aligns homologous templates from experimentally determined structures.**

- **Model Building: Constructs a 3D model based on the alignment between the target and the selected template.**

**40FB** was used to model the protein,Model 04 was selected as it showed the Highest no of residues in the Ramachandran Plot.

**Align command in PYMol:**

The `align` command is used to align two structures based on their 3D coordinates. This is helpful when comparing proteins, identifying structural similarities, or analyzing differences between two related structures.

**Alpha-fold modeling of protein:**

**AlphaFold is an advanced AI system developed by DeepMind that predicts protein 3D structures with high accuracy, using only their amino acid sequences. It revolutionized the field of structural biology by solving one of biology's grand challenges: the protein folding problem.**

**Key features of AlphaFold include:**

- **Deep Learning: Utilizes neural networks to predict atomic-level protein structures based on evolutionary, physical, and geometric constraints.**

- **Accuracy: Achieves near-experimental accuracy in many cases, outperforming traditional methods like homology modeling.**

- **AlphaFold Protein Structure Database: Provides open access to millions of predicted protein structures, covering a large portion of known protein sequences.**

**Calculated RMSD:**

**Executive: RMSD =   34.155 (696 to 696 atoms)**

\


**Comparison of Alpha-fold vs SWISS-MODELLER:**

- **AlphaFold RMSD (34.155 Å over 696 atoms): This high RMSD suggests that the AlphaFold model deviates significantly from the experimental structure of the protein (40FB). This could imply notable structural differences, possibly due to limitations in predicting certain regions or flexibility in the protein.**

- **SWISS-MODEL RMSD (0.083 Å over 1489 atoms): This extremely low RMSD indicates an almost perfect alignment between the SWISS-MODEL prediction and the experimental structure (40FB), showing that the homology model is highly accurate, likely because a close template was available for modeling.**

**These values highlight the difference in structural accuracy between the two approaches for this specific protein, with SWISS-MODEL performing better in this case.**
